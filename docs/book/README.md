# Hyperdex python API wrapper

Hyperdex is a clever fast key value storage system.
To make it easier to develop upon, the API provides a basic class structure for managing and maintaining the spaces and its data.

Much of the supplied hyperdex python API is lightly wrapped to provide:

+ Space definitions with install management
+ in out data routines
+ model structures with python exposure
